# XP Core Values
## Communication 
*	Communication played integral role in our team project. We maintained healthy communication throughout the project cycle.
*	We had weekly scrum calls to discuss upon the project progress on an individual front. Each member provided information about the ongoing and upcoming task and informed about blockers or impediments. Each blocker was considered on a high priority to maintain the consistent progress.
*	We had sprint planning sessions and design discussions, which helped in achieving milestones in every sprint.
*	We communicated and discussed about technical problems and timely shared knowledge among the team members via planned technical discussions. We had discussions regarding selection of technology stack, database table fields and API attributes.
*	We maintained the JIRA board to keep track of assigned stories and features which helped in understanding the dependencies allowing wise effort distribution. Burnt down chart helped in understanding the project progress on the timely manner.
## Simplicity
*	Understanding the requirement and implementing the exact ask is essential in project development.
*	We figured out the actual requirement and expectation of the application. We followed a protocol to work upon what is needed and keep the team focused on what is asked for, but no more.
*	We simplified each task to achieve small milestones on timely manner.
*	We tried to remove complexity while designing front end and backend of the application.
*	We implemented code refactoring to maintain clean and easily understandable and manageable code.
## Feedback
*	We followed iterative feedback mechanism while designing and developing the application
*	Team planned and executed sprint demos to showcase the functionality to the entire team. Team used to discuss about the developed features and provide feedback upon the workflow and implementation. This helped in the granular dissection of requirements and finding different scenarios of the functionality.
*	After every story completion, developer assigned the story to other team members for review. Team members were encouraged to provide review comments before merging the code with main branch. This helped in maintaining the code quality resulting in less bugs and modular code base.
##Courage
*	Courage is one of the core values that team trusted throughout the project development. Each team member was supported to come up with the better and new ideas during the project design phase.
*	Team was always encouraged to provide the feedback and opinion about certain tasks and process.
*	In the agile development, many a times it is unavoidable to completely scrap a feature or remove a block of code to get the expected and only required functionality. Courage helped team members to stay focused on the ultimate goal while going through hurdles during development phase.
## Respect
*	The core value respect provides the healthy and positive environment within the team.
*	We gave upmost priority to give respect to individual within the team. Each member was supported for all the ideas with brain storming sessions. It was important to listen to the problems and provide help in any way to each team member.
*	We incorporated all the feedback or review comments given by each and every team member with no doubt about the capabilities of individual.
*	We considered the technical expertise of each member and selected the technology stack accordingly. We figured out that the team member not only gives the best when he is working in the supportive and encouraging environment, but he tries to learn and achieve new milestones in the process.
